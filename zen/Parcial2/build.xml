<!-- ==================== All Target ====================================== -->

<!--

  The "all" target is a shortcut for running the "clean" target followed
  by the "compile" target, to force a complete recompile.

-->

  <target name="all" depends="clean,compile"
   description="Clean build and dist directories, then compile"/>



<!-- ==================== Clean Target ==================================== -->

<!--

  The "clean" target deletes any previous "build" and "dist" directory,
  so that you can be ensured the application can be built from scratch.

-->

  <target name="clean"
   description="Delete old build and dist directories">
    <delete dir="${build.home}"/>
    <delete dir="${dist.home}"/>
  </target>



<!-- ==================== Compile Target ================================== -->

<!--

  The "compile" target transforms source files (from your "src" directory)
  into object files in the appropriate location in the build directory.
  This example assumes that you will be including your classes in an
  unpacked directory hierarchy under "/WEB-INF/classes".

-->

  <target name="compile" depends="prepare"
   description="Compile Java sources">

    <!-- Compile Java classes as necessary -->
    <mkdir    dir="${build.home}/WEB-INF/classes"/>
    <javac srcdir="${src.home}"
          destdir="${build.home}/WEB-INF/classes">
        <classpath refid="compile.classpath"/>
    </javac>

    <!-- Copy application resources -->
    <copy  todir="${build.home}/WEB-INF/classes">
      <fileset dir="${src.home}" excludes="**/*.java"/>
    </copy>

  </target>



<!-- ==================== Dist Target ===================================== -->


<!--

  The "dist" target creates a binary distribution of your application
  in a directory structure ready to be archived in a tar.gz or zip file.
  Note that this target depends on two others:

  * "compile" so that the entire web application (including external
    dependencies) will have been assembled

  * "javadoc" so that the application Javadocs will have been created

-->

  <target name="dist" depends="compile,javadoc"
   description="Create binary distribution">

    <!-- Copy documentation subdirectories -->
    <mkdir   dir="${dist.home}/docs"/>
    <copy    todir="${dist.home}/docs">
      <fileset dir="${docs.home}"/>
    </copy>

    <!-- Create application JAR file -->
    <jar jarfile="${dist.home}/${app.name}-${app.version}.war"
         basedir="${build.home}"/>

    <!-- Copy additional files to ${dist.home} as necessary -->

  </target>



<!-- ==================== Install Target ================================== -->

<!--

  The "install" target tells the specified Tomcat installation to dynamically
  install this web application and make it available for execution.  It does
  *not* cause the existence of this web application to be remembered across
  Tomcat restarts; if you restart the server, you will need to re-install all
  this web application.

  If you have already installed this application, and simply want Tomcat to
  recognize that you have updated Java classes (or the web.xml file), use the
  "reload" target instead.

  NOTE:  This target will only succeed if it is run from the same server that
  Tomcat is running on.

  NOTE:  This is the logical opposite of the "remove" target.

-->

  <target name="install" depends="compile"
   description="Install application to servlet container">

    <deploy url="${manager.url}"
       username="${manager.username}"
       password="${manager.password}"
           path="${app.path}"
       localWar="file://${build.home}"/>

  </target>


<!-- ==================== Javadoc Target ================================== -->

<!--

  The "javadoc" target creates Javadoc API documentation for the Java
  classes included in your application.  Normally, this is only required
  when preparing a distribution release, but is available as a separate
  target in case the developer wants to create Javadocs independently.

-->

  <target name="javadoc" depends="compile"
   description="Create Javadoc API documentation">

    <mkdir          dir="${dist.home}/docs/api"/>
    <javadoc sourcepath="${src.home}"
                destdir="${dist.home}/docs/api"
           packagenames="*">
      <classpath refid="compile.classpath"/>
    </javadoc>

  </target>



<!-- ====================== List Target =================================== -->

<!--

  The "list" target asks the specified Tomcat installation to list the
  currently running web applications, either loaded at startup time or
  installed dynamically.  It is useful to determine whether or not the
  application you are currently developing has been installed.

-->

  <target name="list"
   description="List installed applications on servlet container">

    <list    url="${manager.url}"
        username="${manager.username}"
        password="${manager.password}"/>

  </target>


<!-- ==================== Prepare Target ================================== -->

<!--

  The "prepare" target is used to create the "build" destination directory,
  and copy the static contents of your web application to it.  If you need
  to copy static files from external dependencies, you can customize the
  contents of this task.

  Normally, this task is executed indirectly when needed.

-->

  <target name="prepare">

    <!-- Create build directories as needed -->
    <mkdir  dir="${build.home}"/>
    <mkdir  dir="${build.home}/WEB-INF"/>
    <mkdir  dir="${build.home}/WEB-INF/classes"/>


    <!-- Copy static content of this web application -->
    <copy todir="${build.home}">
      <fileset dir="${web.home}"/>
    </copy>

    <!-- Copy external dependencies as required -->
    <!-- *** CUSTOMIZE HERE AS REQUIRED BY YOUR APPLICATION *** -->
    <mkdir  dir="${build.home}/WEB-INF/lib"/>
<!--
    <copy todir="${build.home}/WEB-INF/lib" file="${foo.jar}"/>
-->

    <!-- Copy static files from external dependencies as needed -->
    <!-- *** CUSTOMIZE HERE AS REQUIRED BY YOUR APPLICATION *** -->

  </target>


<!-- ==================== Reload Target =================================== -->

<!--

  The "reload" signals the specified application Tomcat to shut itself down
  and reload. This can be useful when the web application context is not
  reloadable and you have updated classes or property files in the
  /WEB-INF/classes directory or when you have added or updated jar files in the
  /WEB-INF/lib directory.

  NOTE: The /WEB-INF/web.xml web application configuration file is not reread
  on a reload. If you have made changes to your web.xml file you must stop
  then start the web application.

-->

  <target name="reload" depends="compile"
   description="Reload application on servlet container">

    <reload url="${manager.url}"
       username="${manager.username}"
       password="${manager.password}"
           path="${app.path}"/>

  </target>
